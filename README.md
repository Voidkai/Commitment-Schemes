# Cryptographic Commitment Schemes

This repo aims to provide a simple and easy to use implementation of cryptographic commitment schemes. The goal is to provide a simple and easy to use interface for the user to create commitments and verify them. The user should not have to worry about the underlying cryptographic primitives.

Primitives for cryptographic commitment schemes.
- operations of field and polynomial.


- Hash commitment
  - hash_commitment.go
- Polynomial Commitment
  - kzg.go
